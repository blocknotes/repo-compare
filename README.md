# Repo Compare
[![gem version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/repo-compare.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/repo-compare)
[![specs](https://github.com/blocknotes/repo-compare/actions/workflows/specs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blocknotes/repo-compare/actions/workflows/specs.yml)

Track changes of another public repository.

Features:
- check multiple paths of a repo;
- create a summary of the changes using git compare (`-s` option);
- create a detailed list of diffs;
- ignore some changes to a specific file, saving hashes locally (`-u` option).

It can be useful keep track of the changes of a master repo from a forked project, eventually preparing a check in the CI.

**IMPORTANT**: the tool will add the other repository as remote source if it's not already present, for this reason it will need write permission. Otherwise you can manually add the remote source (the parameters must match the ones in the config: `source_name` and `source_repo`).

## Installation

- Add to your Gemfile: `gem 'repo-compare', require: false` (and execute `bundle`)
- Create a config file in the root of your project (`.repo-compare.yml`):

```yml
---
source_name: REPO_NAME
source_branch: master
source_base_path: OPTIONAL_INTERNAL_PATH
source_repo: https://github.com/ACCOUNT_NAME/REPO_NAME.git
paths:
  - PATH1
  - PATH2
  - PATH3
  - ...
```

- Execute the binary: `bundle exec repo-compare`

Alternative option, install it at system level: `gem install repo-compare`

Please take a look at the [example1](https://github.com/blocknotes/repo-compare/tree/example1) branch for a installation and usage example.

## Usage

The tool accepts some command line option:

- `-h` or `--help`    : show this help
- `-s` or `--summary` : generate an XML summary of the files changed (useful for CI)
- `-u` or `--update`  : update the config file setting the current hashes to ignore

## Do you like it? Star it!

If you use this component just star it. A developer is more motivated to improve a project when there is some interest.
